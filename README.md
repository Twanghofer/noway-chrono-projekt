# Noway Chrono Projekt

This is a project displaying the progress of the [Noway's](https://twitch.tv/noway4u_sir) Chrono Projekt. You can check it out [here](https://noway-chrono-projekt.vercel.app/).

## Info

The project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the Frontend and [Convex](https://convex.dev/) for the Backend.
<br>
I used [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI components and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment.
<br><br>
This is one of my first project's using convex, so there might be some things are not optimal.
